Description: Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer with tempo-tracks
 Qtractor is an Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application
 written in C++ with the Qt framework. Target platform will be
 Linux, where the Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) for audio,
 and the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI,
 are the main infrastructures to evolve as a fairly-featured
 Linux Desktop Audio Workstation GUI, specially dedicated to
 the personal home-studio.
 .
 The "tt" version of Qtractor provides additional tempo-tracks
 feature. This package may be installed in parallel with the original
 Qtractor package.
